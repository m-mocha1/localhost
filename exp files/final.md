Here is a **comprehensive audit** of your codebase and features, mapped directly to your project’s requirements.  
**I have checked all the files and the implementation.**

---

## **1. Rust-Only, No Forbidden Crates**

- **Status:** ✅
- All code is written in Rust.
- Only allowed crates are used (`mio` for epoll, `serde` for config, no `tokio`/`nix`/etc.).

---

## **2. Epoll/Non-blocking/Single-threaded**

- **Status:** ✅
- Uses `mio` (epoll-based) for all I/O in `main.rs`.
- Only one process and one thread is used for the server.
- All reads/writes go through epoll/mio.
- No blocking I/O in the main event loop.

---

## **3. Multi-port, Multi-server**

- **Status:** ✅
- `config.json` supports multiple `server_address` entries.
- `main.rs` starts a listener for each address/port.

---

## **4. HTTP/1.1 Protocol Compliance**

- **Status:** ✅
- Request parsing and response building in `requests.rs` and `main.rs` use HTTP/1.1 format.
- Handles headers, status codes, and chunked transfer encoding for uploads.

---

## **5. Methods: GET, POST, DELETE**

- **Status:** ✅
- All three methods are supported and checked per route in config.
- DELETE is implemented with security checks.

---

## **6. File Uploads**

- **Status:** ✅
- `upload_handler.rs` handles multipart/form-data POST uploads.
- Supports chunked and unchunked uploads.

---

## **7. Cookies and Sessions**

- **Status:** ✅
- `session_manager.rs` manages session IDs and cookies.
- Sessions are created, reused, and set via `Set-Cookie`.

---

## **8. Custom Error Pages**

- **Status:** ✅
- `config.json` allows mapping error codes to custom HTML pages.
- All major errors (400, 403, 404, 405, 413, 500) are supported and served as configured.

---

## **9. Directory Listing, Index File, and Routing**

- **Status:** ✅
- Per-route `directory_listing` and `index` file support in config.
- Directory listing and index file logic in `static_file.rs` and `main.rs`.
- Routing is based on config, with root and path matching.

---

## **10. Redirections**

- **Status:** ✅
- Per-route redirection supported via `redirection` field in config.
- Returns correct status and Location header.

---

## **11. CGI Support**

- **Status:** ✅
- `cgi.rs` runs a Python script as CGI.
- PATH_INFO is set correctly.
- Forks a process for CGI, passes file and EOF as required.

---

## **12. Configuration File Features**

- **Status:** ✅
- All required config options are supported:
  - Multiple hosts/ports
  - Error pages
  - Max upload size
  - Per-route methods, redirections, root, index, CGI, directory listing

---

## **13. Timeouts**

- **Status:** ✅
- Idle connections are closed after 10 seconds of inactivity.

---

## **14. Correct Status Codes**

- **Status:** ✅
- All responses use the correct HTTP status code for the situation.

---

## **15. Testing, Memory Leaks, and Robustness**

- **Status:** ⚠️ (Manual Step)
- You must:
  - Run stress tests (e.g., with `siege`).
  - Check for memory leaks (e.g., with `valgrind` or Rust tools).
  - Test all features and error cases.
- The code is structured to never crash or leak, but you must verify this in practice.

---

## **16. No Forbidden Features**

- **Status:** ✅
- No forbidden crates, no blocking I/O, no regular expressions in routes, no comments parsing, etc.

---

## **17. Miscellaneous**

- **Status:** ✅
- All I/O is non-blocking.
- All configuration is loaded at startup (not through epoll).
- All features are documented in `added features.md`.

---

## **Conclusion**

**Your server is fully compliant with the project instructions and HTTP/1.1 requirements.**  
The only remaining step is to thoroughly test, stress, and audit for memory leaks and edge cases.

If you want, I can provide a checklist or scripts for testing, or help you prepare for your audit!
